## Note - Skipped 11/23 because I was at Harry Potter World with my family and we didn't get in until close to midnight.  I needed sleep!

### Day 2: November 22nd, 2017 ###
(1:07 - 2pm)

**Progress**:
* Only completed 1 kata on CodeWars and started on another one.
  
**Thoughts**:
While the first kata took me waaay too long to solve (it seems like I generally try to make things into more steps than they need to be), I felt like I knew what to do on the second one right away.  Unfotunately, that wasn't quite the thing I needed to do.  I feel like I got close to solving it, but then it was time for my lunch break to be over so I had to quit.

### Day 1: November 21st, 2017 ###
(1:30 - 2pm, 9:25 - 10:23 pm)

**Progress**:
* Completed 4 kata on CodeWars today
  
**Thoughts**:
Wow, I felt a little rustydoing this even though it seems like it hasn't been very long since I was coding daily.  There's certainly something to be said for daily practice.
