# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 100: October 17th, 2017 ###
(8:06 - 9:47pm, with a 10-minute break in between)

**Progress**:
* Worked on budget app today
  * Added pagination to transactions shown on individual budget's page
  * Added form for entering transactions
  
**Thoughts**:
Yay, day 100!  Felt like just another day working on my budget app, but I can definitely tell I've been learning - even though I've got so much more to learn!  I want to be much faster than I am today at working on Rails apps and coding in general, but I'm still proud of myself.

Today I learned that I do indeed need more than 30 records in my table for the will\_paginates gem to work, and I learned that I need to understand a bit better about how form labels work (rather than just switching things out based on skimming the documentation and seeing something that looked like what I wanted to do).  Right now, I need to figure out why the records in the form don't want to save properly - I have a suspicion that it has to do with the format that the date field wants.  

There are also so many more features to add!  I feel like I could write out a feature map for v1, v2, and maybe even v3 right now for all the fancy stuff I want to do :)

I want to write a longer analysis of some things I've learned during my 100 days and look back through my log, but for now I need to go do some dishes!!
