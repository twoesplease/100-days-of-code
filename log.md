# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17th, 2017

 **Today's Progress**: Started Ruby code for Pegacorn Project & put it under local source control with Git.  Successfully communicated with and parsed outcome from a REST API.

**Thoughts:** So glad I was able to get my gems, homebrew, and rbenv to play nice with each other this morning before starting the challenge.  Looking forward to to the days when I'll be able to do this kind of task on autopilot, and hoping they won't be too long from now.

**Link to work:** Don't have one as it contains my auth credentials for the API I'm accessing.  It's stored in a directory on my machine .

<!--- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. --->

<!--- **Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. --->
