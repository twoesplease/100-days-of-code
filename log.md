# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 7th, 2017 (9:15-10:15pm)

 **Today's Progress**: Started Ruby code for Pegacorn Project & put it under local source control with Git.  Successfully communicated with and parsed outcome from a REST API.

**Thoughts:** So glad I was able to get my gems, homebrew, and rbenv to play nice with each other this morning before starting the challenge.  Looking forward to to the days when I'll be able to do this kind of task on autopilot, and hoping they won't be too long from now.

**Link to work:** Don't have one as it contains my auth credentials for the API I'm accessing.  It's stored in a directory on my machine.

### Day 1: July 8th, 2017 ###

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Pegacorn Project.  I figured out how to get my url params working (it had to do with the allowed filters for the particular endpoint I'm working with), and created a method using DateTime that I plan to use 

**Thoughts**: Earlier today and at the start of my hour of coding I was feeling overwhelmed at how much there is to learn.  Even though that's still true, I have a better handle on what I want my learning plan to be after some research I did earlier.  Also, even working through the small issues I'm running into now give me a boost of confidence that makes me feel excited and hopeful about my ability to keep learning and get proficient with this stuff.
